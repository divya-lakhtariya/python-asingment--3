Que-1 1: What is List? How will you reverse a list? 

------List: A Python list is an ordered and changeable collection of data objects. 	Unlike 	an array, which can contain objects of a single type, a list can contain a 	mixture of objects.
	- Using the reversed() and reverse() built-in function we can reverse the list.
